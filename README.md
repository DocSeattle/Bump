## BUMP
Group project function library for registering, reregistering and logging in users.


### Submodules:
I have broken this library into submodules for easier handling.
#### Bump.Login
Handles login requests from site by getting data from SQL database.

#### Bump.Register
Handles registering and re-registering users.
Uploads user info to SQL database when registering, for login purposes.
